What Is a Thread Pool?

A Thread Pool is a group of pre-created worker threads that are reused to execute multiple tasks.
Instead of creating a new thread for every task:
Threads are created once
Tasks are submitted to a queue
Available threads pick tasks and execute them
In Java, it is managed using: 👉 java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService

Common implementation: java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor

🧠 Why Do We Need Thread Pool?

Creating threads is:
Expensive (memory + CPU)
Slow
Can exhaust system resources if too many are created

Thread pool solves this by:

Reusing threads
Controlling number of active threads
Managing task queue efficiently

🔹 How It Works (Simple Flow)

Tasks are submitted
Tasks go into a queue
Available worker thread picks task
Executes task
Returns to pool for next task

🎯 Uses of Thread Pool
1️⃣ Handling Large Number of Tasks

Example:
Web server handling multiple client requests

2️⃣ Controlling Concurrency

Limit max number of threads to avoid:
CPU overload
Memory exhaustion

3️⃣ Performance Optimization

Thread reuse reduces:
Thread creation overhead
Context switching cost

4️⃣ Background Task Processing

Used in:
Microservices
Batch jobs
Async processing

🔥 Common Types of Thread Pools (Java)

Fixed thread pool
Cached thread pool
Single thread executor
Scheduled thread pool
All created using:
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);

📌 Real-Life Analogy

Restaurant example:
Customers = tasks
Waiters = threads
Kitchen = thread pool
Instead of hiring a new waiter for every customer, you reuse existing ones.

🎓 Interview One-Line Definition

A thread pool is a collection of reusable worker threads that execute submitted tasks,
improving performance and controlling resource usage.
